Goals and Purpose</h1>
<p>The ams Debugger-based On-Target Testing (DOTT) framework is designed as an approach to simplify the on-target testing of firmware developed for <b>Arm Cortex-M</b> microcontrollers. It uses the debugger attached to the target device via SWD or JTAG to control, monitor and alter the execution of firmware on the target. Below is a summary of the goals addressed by the DOTT framework.</p>
<p>Primary goals for the Debugger-based On-Target Testing framework are to enable</p><ul>
<li>firmware testing <b>without modifications</b> of the firmware for testing</li>
<li>firmware component testing <b>without mocking</b> of, e.g., peripherals</li>
<li>firmware testing <b>with selective injection</b> of data into the execution</li>
<li>firmware testing <b>on the original target device</b></li>
<li>firmware testing using <b>the original compiler</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Secondary goals for DOTT are</p><ul>
<li>execution of the <b>test runner and tests on the host</b></li>
<li><b>simple interfacing of external equipment</b> (e.g., for stimulus generation our output monitoring)</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Architecture"></a>
Architectural Overview</h1>
<p>The figure below provides an overview of DOTT's architecture. On the <b>test target</b> on the bottom left the unmodified <b>firmware under test</b> is executed. Strictly speaking, the firmware is not entirely unmodified but a small test helper library is linked into the firmware (cp. <a class="el" href="DeveloperGuide.html">Dev Guide</a>). It provides a well defined entry point for the debugger. In practice, its effects on the firmware are negligible such that this entry point can be even left in place in the production version of the firmware.</p>
<p>On the right side, the <b>debugger</b> hardware is connected to the target via SWD or JTAG. A vital aspect for DOTT's approach is that the debug probe exposes a GNU Debugger (GDB) server interface for debugging clients to connect to. This is fulfilled by debuggers supported by the <a href="http://openocd.org">OpenOCD</a> framework, <a href="https://github.com/mbedmicro/pyOCD">PyOCD</a> but also commercial debuggers such as <a href="http://www.segger.com">Segger</a> J-Link or <a href="http://www.pemicro.com">PE micro</a> debuggers.</p>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p><b>Note:</b> DOTT currently is developed and tested only with <b>Segger J-Link debuggers.</b> For J-Links it also supports auto-start of the GDB server. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the next layer, a <b>GDB client</b> is used to connect to the GDB server. DOTT connects to the gdb client using the GDB machine interface (GDB MI). DOTT uses the <a href="http://www.pytest.org">PyTest</a> unit test framework as <b>test runner</b>. The tests themselves, which are also implemented in Python, are executed by PyTest on the host where they have access to the target via GDB.</p>
<p>Optionally, the tests implemented in Python can also use additional libraries to interface with <b>external test equipment</b> to generate stimuli towards the target or monitor target outputs.</p>

DOTT Architecture Overview.</div></div>
 <h1><a class="anchor" id="OV_TestTechniques"></a>
Supported Test Techniques</h1>
<p>DOTT supports different approached for testing which are described below. A fundamental feature of DOTT used for all tests types is its ability to automate the programming of the target's FLASH memory and to bring the target into a defined state (target reset).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="OV_ComponentTesting"></a>
Component Testing</h2>
<p>DOTT supports the implementation of component (unit) tests where an isolated function (or set of functions) is tested by providing input vectors and checking output vectors. Input vectors are defined in the tests implemented on the host and are provided, via the debugger, to the function(s) on the target. Output vectors are transferred back to the host where they are checked against expected results. With DOTT it is not only possible to invoke functions implemented in the target's firmware but it is also possible to inject (faulty) data into the execution flow. E.g., if the function under test calls some other functions, the return values of these functions can be changed and the reaction of the function under test can be observed.</p>
<p>For component testing, the target is typically booted up and halted at a certain location (test hook). Functions under test are then called from the context of this test hook.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="OV_FreeRunning"></a>
System / 'Free-Running' Testing</h2>
<p>The free-running mode is meant for system testing where the target is running and stimuli are provided to the target via its external interfaces (e.g., I2C). In addition to observing and checking the response to the stimuli in the public interface DOTT allows to add breakpoints to the target such that, e.g., it can be verified that a given stimulus actually triggers expected on-target functionality. One can also check if if externally provided data was correctly written into target memory (e.g., think about checking for endianess issues when doing data deserialization). Another usage example would be a bootloader where FLASH erase/write operations are triggered via the target's external interface and DOTT allows to inspect the target's memory and verify if it was correctly written/erased.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Support"></a>
Support</h1>
<p>The framework is developed and maintained by <a href="http://www.ams.com">ams AG</a>. In fall 2019 it was decided to release DOTT via GitHub to the general public. DOTT continues to be used and maintained by ams AG. Contributions from industry and the open-source community are highly encouraged. Please submit your feature requests, bug reports and support questions via the project's <a href="https://github.com/ams-ag/dott/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a></p>

<li>This section presents the goals of DOTT along with its high-level architecture and concepts.</li>
<li>The <a class="el" href="ReleaseNotes.html">Release Notes</a> list the features and know limitations of DOTT and provide a version history.</li>
<li>The <a class="el" href="SetupAndTarget.html">Setup</a> section describes how to install the framework and what target system is need to execute the included example tests.</li>
<li>The <a class="el" href="ComponentTesting.html">Component Tests</a> section gives examples how to use DOTT for component tests. It compares firmware functions under test and corresponding test code on the host and gives readers an immediate understanding of the core concepts of DOTT.</li>

Specifically, it covers all the technical details required for test developers to leverage the full potential of DOTT. Furthermore, it outlines the steps for creating a new test project and provides a technical reference.</li>
<li>The <a class="el" href="ReferencePlatform.html">Reference Platform</a> section describes how to turn an off-the-shelf evaluation board into a reference and evaluation platform for DOTT. All examples shipped with DOTT are implemented to run on this reference board.</li>
<li>The <a class="el" href="ExternalEquipment.html">External Test Equipment</a> section discusses how to integrate external components into the DOTT test execution flow.</li>
